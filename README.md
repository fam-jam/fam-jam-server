# Knot Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/knotworks/knot-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/knotworks/knot-server)

A decentralized server to build private social networks from.

## Background

My Family and I have used an app called [Path](https://path.com) to share private moments for a number of years. It's served us well, however with the [direction it's been going](http://blog.path.com/post/162970476867/explore-the-world-through-path) lately, and the constant worry of it going the way of the dinosaur unexpectedly, I wanted to build something similar as a contingency plan. This repository represents the server-side component that one would self-host to act as the API for their private network, and it's up to you to design and write a client that interfaces with it. Down the road I may release a sample client to get you started as well. Many of the currently supported features exist to mimic much of the functionality of Path, and that's generally the _Path_ (hehe) I'll take. As this project is fully open source, you are more than welcome to add, remove or modify any functionality you wish!

Thanks for checking out Knot!
